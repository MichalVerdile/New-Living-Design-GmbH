## Project Overview
This is a React project built with Vite and TypeScript. The project is set up for modern web development with fast hot module replacement and optimized builds.

## Development Guidelines
- Use TypeScript for all new components and utilities
- Follow React functional component patterns with hooks
- Use CSS modules or styled-components for styling
- Implement proper error boundaries and loading states
- Write unit tests for components using Vitest (built into Vite)
- Follow accessibility best practices

## Code Style
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Prefer functional components over class components
- Use proper TypeScript typing for props and state
- Implement proper error handling
- Keep components small and focused on single responsibility

## Architecture
- Components should be organized in the `src/components` directory
- Utils and helpers in `src/utils`
- Types and interfaces in `src/types`
- API calls and data fetching in `src/services`
